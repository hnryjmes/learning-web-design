# Learning Web Design

*5th Edition, by Jennifer Niederst Robbins*

`Notes by Henry Cooksley`

### Foreword

### Preface

"Learning Web Design, Fifth Edition, is divided into five parts, each dealing with an important aspect of web development."

"I start off with some important general information about the web design environment, including the various roles you might play, the technologies you might learn, and tools that are available to you."

"We'll cover the markup for text, links, images, forms, and embedded media."

"It provides an introduction to Responsive Web Design, as well as the tools and techniques that are part of the modern developer's workflow."

"You'll get to know some ways that JavaScript is used (including DOM scripting) and existing JavaScript tools such as polyfills and libraries that let you put JavaScript to use quickly, even if you aren't quite ready to write your own code from scratch."

"It also includes a chapter on SVG graphics, which offer great advantages for responsive and interaction design."

Content Wrangling

"Anyone who used the title “web designer” needs to be aware that everything we do supports the process of getting the content, message, or functionality to our users."

Information architecture

Content strategy

All Manner of Design

User Experience, Interaction, and User Interface design

"The User Experience designer takes a holistic view of the design process - ensuring the entire experience with the site is favorable."

"UX design is based on a solid understanding of users and their needs based on observations and interviews."

User research and testing reports

"Site designs often begin with user research, including interviews and observations, in order to gain a better understanding of how the site can solve problems or how it will be used."

Wireframe diagrams

"The purpose of a wireframe diagram is to indicate how the screen real estate is divided and where functionality and content such as navigation, search boxes, form elements, and so on, are placed."

"Colors, fonts, and other visual identity elements are deliberately omitted so as not to distract from the structure of the page."

Site diagram

Storyboards and user flow charts

"A storyboard traces the path through a site of application from the point of view of a typical user (a persona in UX lingo)."
